<h1 class="text-flicker-in-glow">Hi.</h1>     

<p>Thank you for doing this Survey, this is part of an expirement to compare between three Augmented Reality Platforms. And as you've possibly guessed, we're tackling one specific feature of these platforms.</p>

<h2>Light Estimation</h2>

<p>The goal of Light Estimation is to make any virtual objects seem more realistic in any given scene, by adjusting their light intensity to match the ambient light intesity. 
  This test will focus on rating how these platforms will perfrom under different light levels, and with different materials.</p>

<p>All you have to do is rate a few pictures, and watch a few videos!</p>
